Hi, I'm Eugene — Principal Software Engineer & Architect
Upwork Success Rate Since

�‍💻 About Me
I am a Principal Software Engineer and Architect with 20+ years of professional experience building complex systems.

My background is in Mathematics and Computer Science. This gives me strong fundamentals in algorithms, data structures, and theoretical foundations of machine learning.

I value clean architecture and well-structured code. My preferred patterns include SOLID principles, Event-Driven Architecture, CQRS, and asynchronous programming. These approaches allow me to build systems that are maintainable, scalable, and easy to reason about.

I earned my Microsoft Certified Solution Developer (MCSD) certification in 2005. Since then, I have worked professionally with C#, .NET ecosystem, and many other technologies.

Over the years, I have built and shipped products for multiple startups. I have experience in full product lifecycle — from initial architecture to production deployment and maintenance.

My project portfolio covers many domains: e-commerce, booking and ticketing systems, project management and issue-tracking software, real-time online games, and various real-time communication systems. I have extensive experience with trading platforms, exchange APIs, cryptocurrency, and fintech in general.

Since 2016, I maintain a TOP rated+ profile on Upwork with 100% Job Success Score. My clients range from early-stage startups to established companies.
